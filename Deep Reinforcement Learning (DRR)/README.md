This is a [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) implementation to DRR (Deep Reinforcement Learning), that I wrote from scratch. It took me solid 7-8 days with full 10-hours each day to reimplement the code from PyTorch to Tensorflow Frameworks.

This project is built by referring to these papers [[1]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.12027.pdf) and [[2]](https://aclanthology.org/P19-1064.pdf)

Also, this project follows the algorithm from [This Repo](https://github.com/irskid5/drr_restaurants), which implemented in PyTorch Framework.

Questions, suggestions, or correctness can be posted as issues.

I'm using `Tensorflow 2.7.0` in `Python 3.9`.
