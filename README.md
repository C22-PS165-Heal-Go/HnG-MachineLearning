## Dataset 💾
The dataset that we used when building this application is a dataset that we created ourselves by distributing questionnaires to the public and scraping from Google Reviews.
- Deep Learning Model : [Dataset](https://github.com/C22-PS165-Heal-Go/HnG-MachineLearning/blob/main/dataset/questionnaire_dataset.csv)
- Deep Reinforcement Learning Model : [Dataset](https://github.com/C22-PS165-Heal-Go/HnG-MachineLearning/blob/main/dataset/Dataset_Dest_Rating.xlsx)

## Model 📈
We use the Deep Learning model to create a tourist destination recommendation system using datasets derived from questionnaires. Meanwhile, for the Deep Reinforcement Learning model using a dataset from Google Review.
- Deep Learning : [Code](https://github.com/C22-PS165-Heal-Go/HnG-MachineLearning/blob/main/src/dl_model.ipynb), [Model](https://github.com/C22-PS165-Heal-Go/HnG-MachineLearning/tree/main/src/model)\
📝 Note : **The highest accuracy of this model is still around 79%, so this model is still in the optimization stage.**
